                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The New York State Regents Exams aim to assess student comprehension of foundational disciplines like science, mathematics, and English. Passing these exams is a statewide requirement for earning a high school diploma. However, the Regents exams also reveal troubling racial disparities in student outcomes. These disparities are not unique to New York but reflect a nationwide issue in how standardized testing measures student readiness and success. In this piece, we’ll explore the broader implications of these inequities, examining not only Regents exams but also national standardized tests like the SAT and ACT.

                <h2>How Educational Inequalities Are Reflected in Regents Exams</h2>
                <p>The Regents exams add another layer to the story. Data shows that Black and Hispanic students pass the Regents at significantly higher rates than their White and Asian counterparts, with pass rates at 59% for Black students and 52% for Hispanic students, compared to 38% for White students and 29% for Asian students. Yet, this does not translate into higher graduation rates, suggesting that the exams do not effectively capture the barriers many students face. </p>
                <p>“It’s strange to see Asian students graduating at high rates but passing the Regents at significantly lower rates,” said Dr. Giovanni Durante, principal of Syosset High School on Long Island. “I don’t have an answer for that. Maybe some underfunded schools are placing a much higher emphasis on the Regents exams to make their results look better.” This inconsistency raises critical questions about the role of the Regents as a measure of academic readiness and whether the emphasis on test preparation may detract from other educational priorities.</p>

                <h2>Racial Disparities in Graduation Rates</h2>
                <p>While pass rates for Black and Hispanic students are relatively strong, graduation rates tell a different story. Asian students had the highest graduation rates in New York State from 2019 to 2023 at 93%, followed closely by White students at 91%. In contrast, Black and Hispanic students lag significantly, with graduation rates at 81% and 82%, respectively. In other words, for every 100 Hispanic or Black students, approximately 20 did not graduate on time, compared to fewer than 10 for Asian or White students.</p>
                <p>“What’s important is not just a test score—it’s the resources and opportunities a student has. The disparities in graduation rates show us that what happens in the classroom and beyond matters just as much, if not more, than a Regents exam,” Dr. Durante said. </p>

                <h2>Broadening the Lens: SAT and ACT Disparities</h2>
               <p>Beyond New York State, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=897" target="_blank">national trends in SAT and ACT scores</a> reveal similar inequities. Asian students consistently outperform other groups on the SAT, with average scores above 1150 between 2017 and 2023. White students also perform well, with averages above 1100. Meanwhile, Hispanic and Black students lag behind, with average scores slightly above 1000 and around 950, respectively.</p> <p>The ACT shows a similar pattern. Asian students have the highest average scores, peaking at 24.2 in recent years, while White students follow with averages around 21. In contrast, Hispanic and Black students consistently score lower, with averages near 17 and 16, respectively. These disparities highlight how access to resources like test preparation and advanced coursework shapes performance on standardized tests.</p><iframe title="Average ACT Scores across different races" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-hOr7r" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hOr7r/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="421" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

                <p>Dr. Durante emphasized the role of privilege in these trends, explaining, “The shift to test-optional policies has shown that standardized testing often reflects privilege rather than ability.” He added, “Sometimes, doing well on a test doesn’t mean you’re smarter—it might just mean you were taught strategies to manipulate the questions.” </p>

                <h2>Significance of These Findings</h2>
                <p>Data from graduation rates, SAT scores, ACT scores, and Regents exams shows that standardized testing often reflects inequities rather than addressing them. Dr. Durante stressed the need for a holistic view when evaluating student readiness, saying, “We need to look at the whole picture—quizzes, homework, class participation, midterms, and projects—not just one standardized test.” He argued that test scores alone fail to capture a student's full potential and overlook key aspects like classroom engagement and long-term academic growth.</p>

            <section class="story">
                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>The gaps in SAT, ACT, and Regents exams point to bigger problems in the education system. Schools in low-income areas, often serving students of color, lack basic resources, experienced teachers, and access to advanced programs. These disadvantages make it harder for students to succeed on standardized tests.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on the future of Regents exams, Dr. Durante said, “New York State has talked for years about removing the Regents, but nothing has been decided. The problem is, while they talk, students are still being held to this outdated metric. We need to rethink how we measure readiness in a way that reflects equity and prepares students for life beyond high school.”</p>
                <p> Addressing these issues will require systemic reform, including increased funding for under-resourced schools, expanded access to tutoring and advanced coursework, and a reimagining of what truly defines student success. Without meaningful change, standardized testing will continue to reflect privilege rather than potential.</p>
